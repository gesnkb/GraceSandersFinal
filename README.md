# A Tutorial on Markdown 
## By: Grace Sanders

### Markdown is a markup language used to format pages in plaintext editors. It is a very useful language to know, and relatively simple to learn. In this tutorial, I will be describing in detail what specifically Markdown is, where it's used, how to use it, and some simple tips and tricks to using it. 
### This tutorial is intended for college students (around ages 18-22) hoping to start utlizing Markdown, and for those with no prior knowledge on the topic interested in learning more!
